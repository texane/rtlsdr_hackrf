implements librtlsdr on top of libhackrf, so that existing rtlsdr
code base can be used on top of HackRF one.

First, install the following libraries:
. libusb
. librtlsdr
. libhackrt

Then, compile using ./build.sh. It will produce librtlsdr.so.0.
Then, use LD_LIBRARY_PATH so the (not statically compiled) binary
will use this new librtlsdr.so.0 instead of the default one. This
makes your hackrf device seen as an rtlsdr dongle from the software
point of view. An example is available in run.sh, which runs rtl_fm.
